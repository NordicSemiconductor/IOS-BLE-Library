# ``iOS_BLE_Library/CentralManager``

### Create a Central Manager

``CentralManager`` is merely a wrapper around `CBCentralManager` with an instance of it inside.

The new instance of `CBCentralManager` can be created during initialization using ``init(centralManagerDelegate:queue:options:)``, or an existing instance can be passed using ``init(centralManager:)``.

If you pass a central manager inside ``init(centralManager:)``, it should already have a delegate set. The delegate should be an instance of ``ReactiveCentralManagerDelegate``; otherwise, an error will be thrown.

### Use of Central Manager

As a wrapper around `CoreBluetooth`'s `CBCentralManager`, ``CentralManager`` cannot work unless the underlying `CBCentralManager` is in a valid state. Mainly, it must be `.poweredOn`. If you're familiar with BLE on Apple Platforms we're sure you have your own strategy to account for this. You can roll your own, listening to the ``stateChannel`` `PassthroughSubject`. We offer a quick solution for `async` environments in the form of ``CentralManager/isPoweredOn()``:

```swift
let centralManager: CentralManager = // init CentralManager

do {
   // Assumed async environment
   await centralManager.isPoweredOn()

   // Bluetooth available
} catch let bleError {
   // Bluetooth unavailable
}
```

### Channels

Channels are used to pass through data from the `CBCentralManagerDelegate` methods.
You can consider them as a reactive version of the `CBCentralManagerDelegate` methods.

In most cases, you will not need to use them directly, as `centralManager`'s methods return proper publishers. However, if you need to handle the data differently (e.g., log all the events), you can subscribe to the channels directly.

All channels have `Never` as their failure type because they never fail. Some channels, like `CentralManager/connectedPeripheralChannel` or `CentralManager/disconnectedPeripheralsChannel`, send tuples with the peripheral and the error, allowing you to handle errors if needed. Despite this, the failure type remains `Never`, so it will not complete even if an error occurs during the connection or disconnection of the peripheral.

```swift
centralManager.connectedPeripheralChannel
    .sink { peripheral, error in
        if let error = error {
            print("Error: \(error)")
        } else {
            print("New peripheral connected: \(peripheral)"
        }
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```
